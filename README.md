## ü§î How to run

This experiment was designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with 4GB of RAM. The Raspberry Pi should be running the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS. To replicate the project, the following steps should be taken:

1. Clone this repository onto the Raspberry Pi
2. Clone the Android Runner in the parent directory of this repository `https://github.com/S2-group/android-runner.git`
3. Install the Android Runner dependencies <br/>
   `cd android-runner && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install the python dependencies <br/>`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install the node dependencies in the receiver directory <br> `cd receiver && npm install`
6. Start 3 sessions to the laptop and run the following:
   2. `node receiver/server.js`
   3. `ngrok http 3000`
9. Finally you can run the experiment using the following command: <br>
   `sudo python3 android-runner android-runner/examples/batterymanager/config_web.json`

All outputs will be stored in the `android-runner/examples/batterymanager/output` directory.
